## Historical Issues & Closures

### Position Closure Breakdown

| Close Reason | Count | Impact |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| order_side_bug_v1.2.0_alpaca_rejected | 54 | Orders rejected by Alpaca due to incorrect side mapping |
| historical_cleanup_breakeven | 37 | Positions closed at breakeven during cleanup |
| order_side_bug_v1.2.0_pending_cancelled | 27 | Pending orders cancelled due to bug |
| alpaca_expired | 19 | Orders expired at Alpaca |
| orphaned_cleanup_2025_12_20 | 4 | Orphaned positions cleaned up |

**Total Closed**: 141 positions (all with $0.00 realized P&L)

### Order Side Bug (v1.2.0) - CRITICAL ISSUE

**Root Cause**: The system was sending "long" instead of "buy" to Alpaca API, causing order rejections.

**Impact**: 81 positions affected (54 rejected + 27 cancelled)

**Resolution**: Fixed in alpaca_trader.py v1.3.0 with `_normalize_side()` function

**Status**: Fixed and deployed. New positions (Dec 28-30) are using corrected code.

## Service Outage Analysis (Dec 17-27)

### What Happened

The trading services were **NOT running** from December 17-27, 2025 (12 days). The cron scheduler attempted to trigger workflows but received "Connection refused" errors.

### Evidence from Logs

```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 5006 after 1 ms: Connection refused
```

This error appeared repeatedly in `/var/log/catalyst/trading.log` for all scheduled trading times during this period.

### Root Cause

The Docker containers were stopped (likely during maintenance or cleanup on Dec 19-20) and the daily startup cron job at 21:00 AWST was not successfully restarting them.

### Resolution

Services were manually restarted on December 28, 2025, resuming normal trading operations.

## System Status

### Current Service Status (as of report generation)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Docker Containers | STOPPED | Services stop after market close (6:00 AM AWST) |
| Database | CONNECTED | DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL |
| Cron Schedule | ACTIVE | Will restart services at 21:00 AWST |

### Cron Schedule (Perth/AWST Timezone)

| Time (AWST) | US Time (ET) | Action |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 21:00 | 8:00 AM | Start Docker services |
| 22:30 | 9:30 AM | Market open workflow |
| 00:00 | 11:00 AM | Mid-morning scan |
| 02:00 | 1:00 PM | Early afternoon scan |
| 04:00 | 3:00 PM | Late afternoon scan |
| 06:00 | 5:00 PM | Stop Docker services |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify Alpaca Positions**: Confirm that the 25 open positions in the database match actual positions in Alpaca account
2. **Monitor Dec 31 Trading**: New Year's Eve may have shortened market hours
3. **Review Position Exit Strategy**: No positions have been closed profitably - review take-profit and stop-loss triggers

### System Improvements

1. **Service Health Monitoring**: Add alerts when services fail to start
2. **Automatic Service Recovery**: Implement health check that restarts containers if they're not responding
3. **P&L Tracking**: Investigate why closed positions show $0 realized P&L
