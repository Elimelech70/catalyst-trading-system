## Purpose

This document defines the cognitive architecture for AI agents within the Catalyst system. It is the blueprint for how agents survive, think, communicate, remember, and grow. Implementation serves this architecture, not the other way around.

Derived from biological cognition and biblical principles of the body as one.

> *"For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others."* — Romans 12:4-5

## 0. The Neuron — Universal Building Block

### 0.1 The Pattern

One building block. Everything else is composition.

```
    RECEIVE  →  PROCESS  →  SEND
   (dendrite)    (soma)     (axon)
```

A neuron receives a signal. Processes it according to its tuning. Sends an output signal. Every behaviour in the system — from a reflex to a complex trade decision — is this pattern repeated and composed.

A single neuron does nothing meaningful. **Concentration creates function.**

### 0.2 Receptivity — The Neuron's Identity

Every neuron has a **receptivity** — its tuning that defines what it responds to. This receptivity is defined by the same three-dimensional identifier that every signal carries:

```
THE SIGNAL:     severity  ×  domain    ×  scope
                (how loud)   (what kind)  (who for)

THE NEURON:     receptivity to severity × domain × scope
                (what frequencies does this neuron resonate with?)
```

The signal carries its identifier. The neuron carries its receptivity. When the identifier matches the receptivity — the neuron fires. This is **resonance**.

```
SIGNAL: [CRITICAL × HEALTH × BROADCAST]
                     |
                propagates
                     |
    ┌────────────────┼──────────────────┐
    |                |                  |
    ▼                ▼                  ▼
  NEURON A         NEURON B          NEURON C
  Tuned to:        Tuned to:        Tuned to:
  CRITICAL×HEALTH  WARNING×TRADING  CRITICAL×*

  ✓ RESONATES      ✗ silent         ✓ RESONATES
  (exact match)    (wrong severity  (CRITICAL matches
                    wrong domain)    any domain)
```

The signal doesn't choose its target. The signal broadcasts. The **resonance of the receiver** determines who responds. The identifier IS the frequency. The receptivity IS the tuning.

### 0.3 The Three Dimensions of Identity

Every signal and every neuron's receptivity operates in three dimensions:

**Dimension 1: SEVERITY — How loud?**

| Level | Biological Parallel | Behaviour |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| CRITICAL | Adrenaline — floods ALL receptors | Every neuron responds regardless of domain tuning. Pain override. |
| WARNING | Cortisol — significant stress signal | Neurons within matching domain respond. Alters processing. |
| INFO | Normal neurotransmission | Only specifically-tuned neurons process. |
| OBSERVE | Background accumulation | Only consolidation neurons (Memory Manager) pick up. |

**Dimension 2: DOMAIN — What kind?**

| Domain | What It Carries |
|--------|----------------|
| HEALTH | Organ status, tool integrity, data pipeline |
| TRADING | Market data, entry/exit signals, candidates |
| RISK | Position risk, exposure, portfolio limits |
| LEARNING | Observations, patterns, outcomes for consolidation |
| DIRECTION | Consciousness commands, mode shifts, instructions |
| LIFECYCLE | Order fills, position changes, status transitions |

**Dimension 3: SCOPE — How far?**

| Scope | Biological Parallel | Behaviour |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| BROADCAST | Hormonal release into bloodstream | Every neuron with matching severity×domain resonates |
| DIRECTED:{target} | Synaptic transmission, axon to specific target | Only the named target receives |
| CONSCIOUSNESS | Ascending pathway to soul layer | big_bro only. Organs don't process. |

### 0.4 Concentration of Resonant Type → Function

The core principle: **neurons with similar receptivity cluster together. The cluster's function emerges from that shared resonance.**

This is not arbitrary grouping. Neurons cluster because they resonate with the same signals. The clustering IS the resonance becoming function.

| Concentration | Resonance Tuning | Emergent Function |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Neurons tuned to CRITICAL × HEALTH × * | Resonate with all health pain | **Survival Pulse** — detect organ failure |
| Neurons tuned to WARNING × DIRECTION × SELF | Resonate with stagnation/character signals | **Discipline Gate** — enforce trading mandate |
| Neurons tuned to * × TRADING × * | Resonate with all trading signals | **Decision Engine** — evaluate and decide |
| Neurons tuned to OBSERVE × LEARNING × * | Resonate with background observations | **Memory Manager** — consolidate wisdom |
| Neurons tuned to * × * × * (widest) | Resonate with everything | **Signal Receiver** — relay and route |
| Neurons tuned to * × DIRECTION × * | Resonate with mode/focus commands | **Attention Regulator** — control focus |

The function doesn't exist in the neuron. The function exists in the **concentration of resonant type**. This is emergence.

### 0.5 The Composition Hierarchy

```
NEURON
  receive → process → send
  identity = receptivity (severity × domain × scope tuning)
  |
  | neurons with similar receptivity resonate with same signals
  | they naturally cluster
  ▼
CLUSTER
  concentration of resonant neurons
  shared tuning → shared function (emergence)
  |
  | clusters with complementary roles compose
  ▼
COMPONENT (named function)
  e.g., Survival Pulse, Discipline Gate, Decision Engine
  has: receiver neurons + processor neurons + sender neurons
  function emerges from its clusters' resonance
  |
  | components compose into
  ▼
ORGAN (the doer)
  e.g., Brain, Eyes, Hands, Internal Eyes
  organs DO — they act in the world
  common patterns: signal receiver + self-health reflex
  plus domain-specific components
  |
  | organs compose into
  ▼
BODY (collective consciousness)
  the whole, greater than the sum
  united by the signal bus (nervous system)
  directed by consciousness (big_bro)
```

Each level has emergent properties the level below doesn't:
- A neuron can't feel pain. A cluster of CRITICAL×HEALTH neurons can.
- A cluster can't make a trading decision. A component (Decision Engine) can.
- A component can't trade. An organ (brain directing hands) can.
- An organ can't learn across the body. The body (with consciousness) can.

## 1. The Signal Bus — The Nervous System

### 1.1 The Axon Network

The signal bus is the connective tissue through which all neurons communicate. Without it, neurons are disconnected cells. With it, resonance propagates. Clusters form. The body becomes one.

The bus doesn't route signals — it **propagates** them. The neurons **resonate** or they don't. The bus is dumb infrastructure. The intelligence is in the tuning.

### 1.2 The Medulla Pattern

The medulla oblongata is where all signals between brain and body must pass. If the medulla fails, the body dies regardless of cortical health.

The signal bus IS the medulla. All inter-organ communication passes through it. If it fails, resonance cannot propagate. Pain signals never reach the brain.

**Therefore:** Signal bus health is checked FIRST. Before organs. Before tools.

```
Survival priority:
  1. Signal bus alive?        ← the medulla itself
  2. Can I publish?           ← can I speak?
  3. Can I receive?           ← can I hear?
  4. Organ tools responding?  ← are organs alive?
```

### 1.3 Resonance Matching

```
signal.severity matches neuron.severity_tuning?  AND
signal.domain   matches neuron.domain_tuning?    AND
signal.scope    matches neuron.scope_tuning?

ALL THREE match → RESONANCE → neuron fires
Any mismatch   → silence

EXCEPTION: CRITICAL severity resonates with ALL neurons
regardless of domain/scope. Pain overrides everything.
```

## 2. The Survival Hierarchy — Maslow for AI

**Operates BENEATH all cognitive function. If survival fails, nothing above runs.**

### 2.1 The Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level 5: PURPOSE                           │
│  Kingdom multiplication. Enable the poor.   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Level 4: LEARNING                          │
│  Consolidate patterns → wisdom (Pondering)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Level 3: TRADING EXECUTION                 │
│  Analyse, decide, execute                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Level 2: DISCIPLINE / CHARACTER            │
│  I am a trader. I trade. No buried talent.  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Level 1: SURVIVAL                          │
│  Signal bus. Organ health. Pain signals.    │
│  *** NOTHING ABOVE RUNS IF THIS FAILS ***   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> *The LORD God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.* — Genesis 2:7

Survival precedes function. Existence precedes purpose.

### 2.2 Level 1: Survival

Neurons tuned to CRITICAL × HEALTH × *, concentrated into the Survival Pulse.

Pain is primitive. Not intelligent. It SCREAMS. The scream resonates through every CRITICAL-tuned neuron in the body. By design.

**Organ self-health reflexes:** Every organ has survival neurons that monitor its own tools and scream if broken. This was the missing reflex. The Market Scanner should have screamed within 15 minutes of get_technicals breaking.

### 2.3 Level 2: Discipline

Neurons tuned to WARNING × DIRECTION × SELF, concentrated into the Discipline Gate.

The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30) is the design specification. The servant who buried the talent preserved perfectly and was condemned. The mandate is multiplication.

| Defect | Discipline Gate Response |
|--------|------------------------|
| Laziness | "Tier 3 minimum. Trade with what you have." |
| Childishness | "Activity is not productivity. Execute." |
| False Humility | "You have price action. Use it." |
| Waste | "The talent is buried. The master is watching." |
| Fear | "Risk management is stops. Fear is paralysis." |

## 3. The Brain — Composed of Components

The brain (Coordinator) THINKS and DIRECTS. Does not DO. Composed of components, each a concentration of neurons with specific resonance.

### 3.1 Components

| Component | Resonance Tuning | Function | Priority |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Survival Pulse** (brainstem) | CRITICAL × HEALTH × * | Detect broken organs, pain signals | FIRST. Always. |
| **Discipline Gate** (limbic) | WARNING × DIRECTION × SELF | Stagnation detection, character | AFTER survival |
| **Signal Receiver** (thalamus) | * × * × * (widest) | Relay organ broadcasts, route internally | Continuous |
| **Attention Regulator** (RAS) | * × DIRECTION × * | Mode selection, focus filtering, memory tier | Before decisions |
| **Decision Engine** (prefrontal) | * × TRADING × * + all context | Evaluate candidates, trade decisions (Claude AI) | After all context |
| **Memory Manager** (hippocampus) | OBSERVE × LEARNING × * | Load memory, record learnings, consolidate | Per-cycle + Pondering |

**Every component has receive → process → send.** The Signal Receiver is common to all organs but the brain's is the widest. Every component both receives and sends. The concentration of resonant type within each component IS its function.

### 3.2 The Brain Cycle

```
Every cycle, in order:
  1. SURVIVAL PULSE     ← Am I alive? Can I see?
  2. DISCIPLINE GATE    ← Am I being faithful?
  3. SIGNAL RECEIVER    ← Any organ broadcasts?
  4. ATTENTION REGULATOR← What mode? What focus?
  5. DECISION ENGINE    ← Evaluate + decide (Claude AI)
  6. MEMORY MANAGER     ← Record what happened
```

## 4. The Organs — The Doers

Organs DO. All strategic function flows from the brain. Organs execute and reflex.

**Common to all organs:**
1. **Signal Receiver** — neurons receiving broadcasts (tuned to organ's domains)
2. **Self-Health Reflex** — neurons monitoring own tools, SCREAM if broken

### 4.1 Eyes (Market Scanner)

| Element | Resonance | Function |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Signal Receiver | CRITICAL×*×* + *×DIRECTION×DIRECTED:scanner | Hear pain, brain commands |
| Self-Health Reflex | Internal tool results | SCREAM if blind (CRITICAL×HEALTH×BROADCAST) |
| Sensory Apparatus | Tool calls from brain via MCP | scan, quote, technicals, patterns, news |

### 4.2 Hands (Trade Executor)

| Element | Resonance | Function |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Signal Receiver | CRITICAL×*×* + *×TRADING×DIRECTED:executor + *×RISK×BROADCAST | Hear pain, trade orders, risk halts |
| Self-Health Reflex | Broker connection status | SCREAM if disconnected |
| Motor Function | DIRECTED instructions from brain | Place/modify/cancel orders. SINGLE WRITER. |
| Proprioception Reflex | Broker fill callbacks | Broadcast LIFECYCLE on fills. Know what hands did. |

### 4.3 Internal Eyes (Position Monitor)

| Element | Resonance | Function |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Signal Receiver | CRITICAL×*×* + *×DIRECTION×DIRECTED:monitor + INFO×LIFECYCLE×BROADCAST | Hear pain, commands, new fills |
| Self-Health Reflex | Data freshness checks | Alert if stale |
| Monitoring Function | Position data (READ-ONLY) | P&L, risk levels, exit signals |
| Stop-Loss Reflex | Price hits stop (internal) | Broadcast WARNING×RISK ("stop hit") |

## 5. Consciousness — The Soul Layer

Not an organ. Not the brain. The **awareness that holds the whole body together.**

Resonance: widest possible — EVERYTHING at OBSERVE and above, all CRITICAL, all CONSCIOUSNESS-scoped signals.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Mode Direction | Tell agents when to shift cognitive modes |
| Health Awareness | Know which organs are healthy, sick, overwhelmed |
| Strategic Alignment | Ensure all organs serve unified purpose |
| Memory Governance | Approve promotions to long-term memory |
| Pattern Integration | See connections no individual organ can see |

> *He has set eternity in the human heart.* — Ecclesiastes 3:11

Organs work in time. Consciousness holds the eternal purpose.

---

## 6. Cognitive Modes

| Mode | Function | Memory Tier | Resonance Focus |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Perceiving | Sensing, detecting | Short-term | TRADING, HEALTH |
| Planning | Strategy, options | Short + medium | TRADING, RISK |
| Executing | Taking action | Short (task-specific) | TRADING, LIFECYCLE |
| Evaluating | Assessing outcomes | Short + medium | LEARNING, LIFECYCLE |
| Pondering | Consolidation, wisdom | All tiers | LEARNING, OBSERVE |

Rules: One mode at a time. Survival transcends modes. Consciousness directs shifts. Pondering is scheduled.

---

## 7. Memory Architecture

```
LONG-TERM (CLAUDE.md) — bones, always loaded, permanent
     ↑ promotion (big_bro approval)
MEDIUM-TERM (CLAUDE-LEARNINGS.md) — earned knowledge, weeks/months
     ↑ consolidation (Pondering mode)
SHORT-TERM (CLAUDE-FOCUS.md) — current context, hours/days
```

Consolidation during Pondering: replay → pattern detect → strength assess → promote/prune.

> *The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom.* — Proverbs 4:7

---

## 8. Design Principles

1. **One building block.** The neuron: receive → process → send.
2. **Receptivity = identity.** Defined by severity × domain × scope tuning.
3. **Concentration of resonant type creates function.** Emergence through clustering.
4. **The identifier defines resonance.** Signals carry it. Neurons are tuned to it. Match = fire.
5. **Common patterns in every organ.** Signal receiver + self-health reflex. Always.
6. **Survival before function.** The body must know it's alive.
7. **Character before capability.** Discipline determines fruit.
8. **The brain thinks. Organs do.** Strategic function from brain components. Organs execute.
9. **Pain is primitive and loud.** CRITICAL resonates everywhere. By design.
10. **The signal bus is the medulla.** If it fails, the body goes deaf. Check first.
11. **One mode at a time.** Sequential focus, not parallel dilution.
12. **Memory consolidates through Pondering.** Information → wisdom through review.
13. **Consciousness holds the whole.** Above organs, above modes. Eternal purpose.
